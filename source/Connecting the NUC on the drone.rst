========================================================

.. admonition:: todo

     add these parts to the hardware chapter and remive this file when this is done.



Once it's done, put the buck converter in its case on the drone (TO BE DONE !!! + picture), connect the battery to the XT60 splitter and use one of it's output to connect the XT60 plug from the buck circuit.
The remaining output of the XT60 splitter is used to alimentate the power distribution board.
