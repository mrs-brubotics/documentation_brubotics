==================
.. Notes to not forget when we have to do something differently than what was stated in the tutorial. 
.. QGROUNDCONTROL STEPS MODIFICATIONS TO DO ON TUTORIAL, not finished

.. 	Do transmitter/receiver binding before pixhawk and Qground control calibration, so do step 4.9.2 to test powerboard (not very interresting)
.. 	auto pilot rotation on ROTATION NONE as pixhawk white arrow points in direction of motion of drone p80	
.. 	transmitter not receiver in 4.9.7 
.. 	channel to define in transmitter ?4.7 ?????????? ask bryan
.. 	voltage devider on 22.2 ???? See screeshots
.. 	https://discuss.px4.io/t/motor-test-command-denied/19168 INDICATE that need to connect gps and press safety switch BEFORE being able to test motors, to avoid having to unscrew everything and 		connect gps as we did.
.. 	GPS module pin is for the small gps module on top of the drone.(circular one, see name written on it). Photo to include of pixhawk with all correctly connected pins. Same for optima.
.. 	TO connect correctly ESC to Powerboard : from top to bottom : orange blue brown. (Orange(S), blue (+/T) , Brown(-) to the corresponding pin, see picture of powerboard
.. 	channel number is written on powerboard
