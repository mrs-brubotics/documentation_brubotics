Welcome internal collaborators (i.e. VUB / visiting researchers, MA 1/2 students)!

Before you can do high-quality research, you need to acquire - quite a LOT of skills - before you can demonstrate your ideas on real robots. 
We encourage all beginners to first go through the tutorials listed below as to build sufficient expertise with this framework.
Moreover we ask all collaborators to document their research (also what does NOT work is valuable!) in well-explained tutorials and to improve the unclear or wrong parts of the existing tutorials.

A good documentation:
    * is a tutorial-style report which allows seemless reproducability of research results;
    * automatically teaches the new collaborator and does not require additional help from an expert to reproduce the results;
    * does NOT look like a scientific paper or a PhD / MA thesis report. The focus of a tutorial is on the pratical setup and implementation aspects to reproduce experiments and not on the analysis of the research results;
    * is never finished and can always be improved.
Remember, the better you document your work in this tutorial, the easier you will get help from others and the more chance your high-quality research will be used in the end!
