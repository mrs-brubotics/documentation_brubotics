Building the Hardware
=====================
This chapter explains which components are to be ordered and and how to build a custom UAV from its different components.
We provide details for the development of two distinct UAV versions based on the frame size: an F450 and a T650 UAV.
Moreover, we provide the details of additional hardware modules that extends the functionality of the UAVs.
To know which UAV and additional hardware can be used for which type of experiments, please read

.. admonition:: note

   The components listed above are all you need to build a UAV for manual flight. Optionally, if one wants to build a UAV for more advanced autonomous flight, one will need some of (your choice) the additional components listed below.

* **Companion computer**: the main computational unit on-board the UAV, used to compute most estimation, planning and control algorithms in real-time.

  *Choice*: the Intel NUC BXNUC10i7FNK2.

   .. figure:: _static/nuc.jpg
      :width: 800
      :alt: alternate text
      :align: center

      Intel NUC BXNUC10i7FNK2

* **FTDI cable**: the FTDI cable is a USB to Serial (TTL level) converter which allows for a simple way to connect TTL interface devices to USB. The I/O pins of this FTDI cable are configured to operate at 5V. It basically enables the Pixhawk and the companion computer to communicate.

  *Choice*: To check correct name

     TODO ADD CORRECT NAME

* **DC-DC converter**: enables to provide the appropriate supply voltage to the companion computer which is typically in a different range of voltage/current/power as the battery.

  *Choice*: Wingoneer XL4016E1 (input: 4-40V, output: 1.25-36V at max 8A, max power: 200W). Since the 6S LiPo battery (i.e., a Turnigy Graphene Professional 12000mAh 6S15C LiPo Pack) provides at most 25.2V and at least 18.0V and the Intel NUC companion computer needs a supply voltage between 12V and 19V and has a rated power supply of 19V/6.33A, the converter must be able to take 18V-25.2V in and deliver 19V/6.33A (or 121W).

* **Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS**: RTK is a GPS-based positioning system that allows to get more precise (i.e., cm-precise) global (in XY and Z) position from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. It is used additionality to the standard GPS senor on-board the UAV which typically only obtain m-level precision. The RTK system typically consists of a stationary ground "base" station that sends corrections to an RTK module on-board the UAV which is called the "rover". Both devices individually can get GNSS measurements with usual GPS precision. The RTK system computes the baseline, the difference between both measurements then gives the roverâ€™s position relative to the base.

  *Choice*: the Emlid Reach M2 UAV Mapping Kit. It is composed of the Emlid Reach RS2 as the base and the Emlid Reach M2 attached to the UAV as the rover. To the latter is connected via a cable the Multi-band GNSS antenna.

   Once the final designs are finished of both your thesis, I will need the inventor files and all stl files of the UAV (also for the F450 from which you started). I will put them on a drive that people can download it. We cannot put it on github since too large files. 
   They are accessible here (TO DO).

We 3D print all these pieces with 20% infill:

* **Main piece (x 1)**: used to provide enough space for all the components. The PDB is fixed on its lower stage, the Pixhawk and its middle stage and the Intel NUC on its top stage.

Step-by-step assembly instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section you will learn how to fix all the components on their (custom-made) piece, assemble everything, and solder/connect every cable/connector to electronic components.

**Goal**: assemble the UAV that looks like in this CAD:

.. admonition:: todo

   in the picture above are missing several components. There is no NUC, battery, Reach M2, Antenna, GPS, ... A final assembly has ALL componenents (even screw). The only thing you cannot draw in CAD are the cables and connectors. If a user want to build it, it helps to see how all componenets fit in the custom-made parts.

**Required tools**:

.. admonition:: todo

   list the tools needed during the assembly: e.g. soldering iron, screwdriver numbers...

**Tips**:

.. admonition:: note

   Every time you solder cables, put a piece of shrink tube beforehand on the cables and heat them on the soldering once it is done.

**Steps**

.. admonition:: todo

   When building the second drone you need to add the steps of "Connecting the NUC on the drone" in this section in a logical order. 
   This should not be a seperate section as you need to explain the build procedure of how to build the autonomous drone (as you design is made for that one).

1. Mount the frame as explained `in this tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddvgs200OaY&ab_channel=MultiCopterBuild>`__. You only need to attach the arms to the body and you can skip the assembly of the legs and the top part.

2. Drill the holes of all the 3D printed pieces to deal with imperfections due to shrinkage. Use a drill bit of size 2.5mm for every hole **NOT** directly touching the frame. For the holes used to fix the parts on the frame itself, use a 3mm drill bit.

.. admonition:: todo

   I have difficulties understandign what you mean with these 2 categories of parts. Can you give a list of parts (see names above) that need which drill size?

   Take picture on white background (use a clean white sheet of paper, you can find those at the printer up the stairs in front of you). Make sure there are no unnecessary things (noise) in the picture. In this case we do not need to see the soldering yet. Crop the image to what is actually useful. **these comments applies to all pictures below you take of the prototype**

4. Solder the three motor cables to the ESC in arbitrary order. Repeat for all ESCs.

     The ordering of the connectors will be corrected later in the calibration phase. Make sure you allow the space to resolder thse cables easily.

5. Solder the three signal cables from the ESC (blue, brown and orange) to a jumper cable. Try to keep the same colors (blue on blue etc). Repeat for all ESCs.

10. You could now attach the propellors to the motors. However, for safety you should only do this when preparing for a real flight.

  .. admonition:: todo

     Take picture

11. Take four pairs of power supply cables (more or less 18cm long, thick red and black cables, a single pair per motor). Make sure that the four pairs can reach the ESCs starting from the middle of the frame. Solder all the pairs on the power distribution board (PDB). The position of each pair is shown in the picture below. As the UAV requires four motors but the PDB can supply up to eight motors, you can solder each red cable to both B+ connections available on each corner of the PDB. In each corner, where the red cables are, choose one of the two GND connection to solder the black cables.

      The picture above doesn't replace this one, I still need to improve it.
     

  .. admonition:: todo

     Take new picture(s) with the following corrections:
     i) less noise, so do not show jumber cables going to the PDB as you did not tell this before in the instructions. If you forgot this, then add it in a step before. 
     ii) The lengths of the cables: say how long you cut the cables in the text above (e.g. XX cm), 
     iii) a pair with an XT60 connector on them (provided with the PDB) is not visible on the picture what you do with it. So maybe not important here, but say the elngth of the cable so if we don't see the cable we know at elast how long it should be.

12. Fix the PDB to the "Main piece" by help of 4x M3 bolts (head on bottom), use the 4 holes in the middle of the "Main piece".

Cable-Suspended Payload Module
-------------------------------

.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael: write this section on the the hardware design and construction of the module similar as we explained it for the UAV above. Make sure to take clean pictures on a white background without noise and that they are cropped. (see my comments before for UAV)

This module is installed at the bottom of the UAV and allows to measure the state (position and velocity) of a cable-suspended load hanging below the UAV. 

.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael todo: integrate the next section better in the hardware building chapter using a similar structure as for UAV (see example given below). Give more pictures and explain better each step of the setup.

18.1 Encoders and material needed (TO INTEGRATE BETTER)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to measure the position of the load attached to the UAV, we use encoders to measure the angles of ball joint. Based on this information, the position of the payload in the inertial and word frame can be computed easilly (with the other states measured elsewhere of course).
The encoders are the `EMS22A <https://www.bourns.com/docs/product-datasheets/EMS22A.pdf>`__ and their data is read using 
an `Arduino Uno <https://benl.rs-online.com/web/p/arduino/7697409?cm_mmc=BE-PLA-DS3A-_-google-_-PLA_BE_NL_Raspberry_Pi_%26_Arduino_%26_Development_Tools_Whoop-_-(BE:Whoop!)+Arduino-_-7697409&matchtype=&pla-341920527054&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgYSTBhDKARIsAB8KukvAlQU51p7JJ5_edjdlsALUf8YW28bD243x1uw75FKns0QKy6QeSckaAlJREALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds>`__

.. note::
  It is better to use flexible cables to do the circuit as rigid ones might disconnect more easily in case they are pulled a bit.

Components
^^^^^^^^^^^
This section lists all the components required to build the Suspended Payload Module for a UAV.
This is currently only compatible with the 650 UAV.

Off-the-shelf
**************

* **Part1**: explain generally.

  *Choice*: specific product name you ordered.

  .. admonition:: todo

     make sure the picture gets cropped (as to delete the excessive white borders)

  .. admonition:: note

     add a note if required

* **Part2**: do same here
  do same here

* **Other**: 

   Electrical cables: 
      * 20 x this used for that
      * 10 x this used for that

   Electrical connectors: 
      * 3 x this used for that
      * 5 x this used for that
   
   Mechanical connectors (screw, bolts and nuts): 
      * 3 x this used for that
      * 5 x this used for that
   
   Other?:
      * 3 x this used for that
      * 5 x this used for that


  .. admonition:: todo

     add here all screws, nuts, and their sizes, and other things like tape, straps, jumper cables, soldering iron, cables (which type of cable thickness and flexible), connectors (all yellow connectors or metal connectors to power things) and explain for what these are used.
     Old text of Maxime I placed here: All the holes used to attach something directly on the frame are for M3 bolts and the other holes M2.5 bolts. Use M3x12mm and M2.5x12mm bolts.

Custom-made
************
In this section all custom made parts to build the Suspended Payload Module.

.. admonition:: todo

   Once the final designs are finished of both your thesis, I will need the inventor files and all stl files of the UAV (also for the F450 from which you started). I will put them on a drive that people can download it. We cannot put it on github since too large files. 
   They are accessible here (TO DO).

We 3D print all these pieces with 20% infill:

* **Main piece (x 1)**: used to provide enough space for all the components. The PDB is fixed on its lower stage, the Pixhawk and its middle stage and the Intel NUC on its top stage.

     for completeness add picture of how Motor bottom fixation is used to connect frame to Motor top fixation

* **Battery case with side (x 2), front (x 1) and core (x 1) piece**: used to attach the battery to the frame.

  .. admonition:: todo

     add pictures of all pieces

Step-by-step assembly instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section you will learn how to fix all the components on their (custom-made) piece, assemble everything, and solder/connect every cable/connector to electronic components.

**Goal**: assemble the Suspended Payload Module that looks like in this CAD: 

.. figure:: _static/drone.jpg

   Fully assembled CAD of the payload module T650 UAV and when attacked to the T650 UAV

**Required tools**:

.. admonition:: todo

   list the tools needed during the assembly: e.g. soldering iron, screwdriver numbers...

**Tips**:

.. admonition:: note

   Every time you solder cables, put a piece of shrink tube beforehand on the cables and heat them on the soldering once it is done.

**Steps**

1. Mount the frame as explained `in this tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddvgs200OaY&ab_channel=MultiCopterBuild>`__. You only need to attach the arms to the body and you can skip the assembly of the legs and the top part.

2. Drill the holes of all the 3D printed pieces. Use a drill bit of size 2.5mm for every hole **NOT** directly touching the frame. For the holes used to fix the parts on the frame itself, use a 3mm drill bit.

.. admonition:: todo

   I have difficulties understandign what you mean with these 2 categories of parts. Can you give a list of parts (see names above) that need which drill size? 

.. admonition:: todo

   I assume you drill because they did not print perfectly? Just to be sure you printed the holes with the 3D printer?

Your Suspended Payload Module is built!
