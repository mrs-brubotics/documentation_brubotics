Building the Hardware
=====================
This chapter explains which components are to be ordered and and how to build a custom UAV from its different components.
We provide details for the development of two distinct UAV versions based on the frame size: an F450 and a T650 UAV.
Moreover, we provide the details of additional hardware modules that extends the functionality of the UAVs.
To know which UAV and additional hardware can be used for which type of experiments, please read

.. admonition:: note

   The components listed above are all you need to build a UAV for manual flight. Optionally, if one wants to build a UAV for more advanced autonomous flight, one will need some of (your choice) the additional components listed below.

* **Companion computer**: the main computational unit on-board the UAV, used to compute most estimation, planning and control algorithms in real-time.

  *Choice*: the Intel NUC BXNUC10i7FNK2.

      :alt: alternate text
      :align: center

      Intel NUC BXNUC10i7FNK2

* **FTDI cable**: the FTDI cable is a USB to Serial (TTL level) converter which allows for a simple way to connect TTL interface devices to USB. The I/O pins of this FTDI cable are configured to operate at 5V. It basically enables the Pixhawk and the companion computer to communicate.

  *Choice*: To check correct name

* **DC-DC converter**: enables to provide the appropriate supply voltage to the companion computer which is typically in a different range of voltage/current/power as the battery.

  *Choice*: Wingoneer XL4016E1 (from `datasheet <https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/1134370/XLSEMI/XL4016E1.html>`__  - input: 4-40V, output: 1.25-36V at max 8A, max power: 200W). Since the 6S LiPo battery (i.e., a Turnigy Graphene Professional 12000mAh 6S15C LiPo Pack) provides at most 25.2V and at least 18.0V and the Intel NUC companion computer needs a supply voltage between 12V and 19V and has a rated power supply of 19V/6.33A, the converter must be able to take 18V-25.2V in and deliver 19V/6.33A (or 121W). Buy it `here <https://www.amazon.fr/WINGONEER-R%C3%A9gulateur-convertisseur-Efficacit%C3%A9-Alimentation/dp/B071L34ZXB>`__.

* **Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS**: RTK is a GPS-based positioning system that allows to get more precise (i.e., cm-precise) global (in XY and Z) position from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. It is used additionality to the standard GPS senor on-board the UAV which typically only obtain m-level precision. The RTK system typically consists of a stationary ground "base" station that sends corrections to an RTK module on-board the UAV which is called the "rover". Both devices individually can get GNSS measurements with usual GPS precision. The RTK system computes the baseline, the difference between both measurements then gives the roverâ€™s position relative to the base.

  *Choice*: the Emlid Reach M2 UAV Mapping Kit. It is composed of the Emlid Reach RS2 as the base and the Emlid Reach M2 attached to the UAV as the rover. To the latter is connected via a cable the Multi-band GNSS antenna.

   see email: "Finalizing CAD files" 15 july.
   Once the final designs are finished of both your thesis, I will need the inventor files and all stl files of the UAV (also for the F450 from which you started). I will put them on a drive that people can download it. We cannot put it on github since too large files. 
   They are accessible here (TO DO).

We 3D print all these pieces with 20% infill:

* **Main piece (x 1)**: used to provide enough space for all the components. The PDB is fixed on its lower stage, the Pixhawk and its middle stage and the Intel NUC on its top stage.

Step-by-step assembly instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section you will learn how to fix all the components on their (custom-made) piece, assemble everything, and solder/connect every cable/connector to electronic components.

**Goal**: assemble the UAV that looks like in this CAD:

   Fully assembled CAD of the T650 UAV

.. admonition:: todo

   in the picture above are missing several components. There is no NUC, battery, Reach M2, Antenna, GPS, ... A final assembly has ALL componenents (even screws and nuts). The only thing you cannot draw in CAD are the cables and connectors. If a user wants to build it, it helps to see how all componenets fit in the custom-made parts. So  compare your CAD with the fully assembled hardware prototype and make sure all componenets are also in CAD.

**Required tools**:

.. admonition:: todo

   list the tools needed during the assembly: e.g. soldering iron, screwdriver numbers...

**Tips**:

.. admonition:: note

   Every time you solder cables, put a piece of shrink tube beforehand on the cables and heat them on the soldering once it is done.

**Steps**

.. admonition:: todo

   When building the second drone you need to add the steps of "Connecting the NUC on the drone" in this section in a logical order. 
   This should not be a seperate section as you need to explain the build procedure of how to build the autonomous drone (as you design is made for that one).

1. Mount the frame as explained `in this tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddvgs200OaY&ab_channel=MultiCopterBuild>`__. You only need to attach the arms to the body and you can skip the assembly of the legs and the top part.

2. Drill the holes of all the 3D printed pieces to deal with imperfections due to shrinkage. Use a drill bit of size 2.5mm for every hole **NOT** directly touching the frame. For the holes used to fix the parts on the frame itself, use a 3mm drill bit.

.. admonition:: todo

   I have difficulties understandign what you mean with these 2 categories of parts. Can you give a list of parts (see names above) that need which drill size?

     Material for steps 3, 4 and 6 to 9

3. Put the motor on the "Motor top fixation" piece (cables go through the elliptical hole), with the help of the screws provided with the motor. Repeat for all motors.

   Take picture on white background (use a clean white sheet of paper, you can find those at the printer up the stairs in front of you). Make sure there are no unnecessary things (noise) in the picture. In this case we do not need to see the soldering yet. Crop the image to what is actually useful. **these comments applies to all pictures below you take of the prototype**


4. Take 3 jumper wires (more or less 30cm) with at least one female connector, remove the other connector and solder them to the three signal cables from the ESC (blue, brown and orange). Try to keep the same colors for all the ESCs. Repeat for all ESCs.


  .. figure:: _static/esc_signal.jpg

     Step 4 


5. Solder the three motor cables to the ESC in arbitrary order. Repeat for all ESCs.

     Step 5 

  .. admonition:: note

     The ordering of the connectors will be corrected later in the calibration phase. Make sure you allow the space to resolder thse cables easily.



6. Fix the "Motor bottom fixation" piece to the frame's part (shown in next figure) with 4x M3 bolts (head on bottom).

11. Take four pairs of power supply cables (more or less 18cm long, thick red and black cables, a single pair per motor). Make sure that the four pairs can reach the ESCs starting from the middle of the frame. Solder all the pairs on the power distribution board (PDB). The position of each pair is shown in the picture below. As the UAV requires four motors but the PDB can supply up to eight motors, you can solder each red cable to both B+ connections available on each corner of the PDB. In each corner, where the red cables are, choose one of the two GND connection to solder the black cables.

     Step 11

12. Fix the PDB to the "Main piece" by help of 4x M3 bolts (head on bottom), use the 4 holes in the middle of the "Main piece". As you can see in the picture below the holes are off-centered. Put the cables with the XT connector on the side with the biggest space (on the right in the picture below) and put them out of the piece thanks to the hole on that side (see second picture). In between the main piece and the PDB, put a nut on each bolt that serve as spacers.

     Step 14

15. Connect the signal cables of the ESCs (by passing them through the windows of the "main piece") to the "FMU-PWM-out" port of the PDB. Use the pins labeled 1 to 4 (1 = front left, 2 = back right, 3 = front right, 4 = back left). Considering the colors of the wires from the ESC, connect the orange ones to the "S" pins, the blue ones to the "+" pins and the brown ones to the "-" pins (on top the orange wires, in the middle the blue cables and at the bottom the brown ones).

19. To exchange data between the NUC and the Pixhawk, the connection between them will be done via one of the USB ports of the NUC, through a FTDI board.
To realize the connection, you'll need an FTDI board, a 6 pins picoblade cable provided with the Pixhawk (that can go to the "TELEM2" port of the Pixhawk), 3 jumper wires of 20cm (Female-X), shrink tubes and non-conductive tape.

     Material needed for step 19.

Now follow these steps : 

* Cut the connector at one end of the picoblade cable; cut the connectors at one end of the jumper wires (keep the female connectors side).
* Prepare shrink tubes on the 3 useful wires (highlighted in green in picture below, cables 2,3 and 6 starting from red one, see documentation `here <http://www.holybro.com/manual/Pixhawk4-Pinouts.pdf>`__) and solder them to the jump wires. Heat the shrink tubes on the welds.
* Put some non-conductive tape at the end of each other wires from the picoblade wire (NOT highlighted in green) in order to avoid short circuit.

     Final circuit step 19

If the connection is done properly you can plug the FTDI board in one of the USB entries of the NUC and the Telecom connector on the Telem2 port of the Pixhawk. When the NUC is powered on, a LED should light up.

20. Fix the Pixhawk case to the "main piece" by help of 4x M2.5 bolts, on the middle stage (use the holes on the edges of the Pixhawk case). The arrow on the Pixhawk must go toward the front of the drone. Try to have the Pixhawk as horizontal as possible in the drone.
Put the other side of the wires for the GPS and the Optima by the back of the drone. For the FTDI, do it by the front (as in the picture below).

29. Normally, the NUC is supplied by a 19V battery through its charger. In reality it can work fine with a voltage going from 12-19V DC.
As the battery provides a DC voltage of 22.2V, a buck converter is needed to connect the NUC to it.
*Take : The Wingoneer XL4016E1 buck converter, a DC plug 11116 to connect the circuit to the NUC, an XT60 male plug to connect the circuit to the battery, 2 pairs of wires red and black, shrink tubes and non-conductive tape.

Cable-Suspended Payload Module
-------------------------------

.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael: write this section on the the hardware design and construction of the module similar as we explained it for the UAV above. Make sure to take clean pictures on a white background without noise and that they are cropped. (see my comments before for UAV)

This module is installed at the bottom of the UAV and allows to measure the state (position and velocity) of a cable-suspended load hanging below the UAV. 

.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael todo: integrate the next section better in the hardware building chapter using a similar structure as for UAV (see example given below). Give more pictures and explain better each step of the setup.
   
.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael todo: put captrions below each figure (see examples UAV). If there is 1 part from 3 views then tell this in caption as now maybe these are 3 different parts we cannot know. For each part tell how many we need e.g., x2, x1, x5. If a part consists out of different subparts also mention their names in the caption.

   .. admonition:: todo

     Raphael: make sure the arduino and electronics board are put in a casing that you attach to UAV. Make sure the cables cannot be pulled out eaily as there will be vibrations, shocks,.. It is very dangerous to leave it open as this is too close to ground and like that cables can be pulled out when landing or taking off or when manually changing batteries. 

Step-by-step assembly instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once everypart is ready, one can proceed with the assembly of the encoder system (mechanical and electronic).

Electronic circuit
******************
First, the electronic components can be assembled. This will require a soldring station as everything will be connected via the stripboard.
On the following figure, one can see the correct circuit to reproduce. 

.. figure:: _static/ElectronicCircuit.png
   :width: 800
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center

.. note::
  It is better to use flexible cables (REF ??? I used the one that are at the lab on big rolls) to do the circuit as rigid ones might disconnect more easily in case they are pulled a bit.

5 cables are needed per encoders. 2 are for the power (V+ and ground) and 3 are for the signal. To solder these correctly, put a small amount of tin on both the pin of the encoder and the cable. Then put the cable on the pin and heat up the two with the soldering iron. Both preapplied tin layers should melt easilly and fuse togheter on the pin. Once the shape of the weld is looking regular and well spreaded over the pin, just take out the iron and wait.
Don't hesitate to redo some of the weldings if they don't look strong enough, as it is very important that the cables stay in place. Also, the welds must not touch each other of course.
Once all the cables are welded to the encoder, cables from the same encoder can be attached togheter with tape to keep a readable circuit and avoid mistakes. 

Mechanical assembly 
*******************

.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael : When building the 2nd encoder, will do pictures of intermediate steps. 


.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael: Make sure the following is desicussed in the tutorial. So you have 2 encoders which I guess cannot mechanically rotate indefinetely (there is some limit?). So how do you fix the encoder such that this limit will never be reached during operation. Then how do you calibrate it such that when the load hangs perfectly down, the angle are 0. Also how/where do you ensure that an increase/decrease of encoder rqw angle is tranformed in the correct sign of angle according to the model used in your thesis. I assume should be somewhere in arduino code. So all this needs to be explained (maybe not all here, but where it actually is the good place to explain). Also discuss if you have 2 drones with bar how you will manage this (do you have to do extra things?).

* **Center piece**  Press fit the collard inside the hollow part of the center piece. When those are in place, connect the two part of the central piece and secure it using two bolts.

.. figure:: _static/PressFit.png

* **Add the bearings** also by doing press fit. Less tension needed as the arm will naturally keep them in place.

* **Assemble the lower arms** using bolt and adding already the attachment piece for the cable.

* **Attach the upper arm to the center piece of the jont and to the support of the battery**.

* **Add the encoders** at the correct location on each arms
