Building the Hardware
=====================
This chapter explains which components are to be ordered and and how to build a custom UAV from its different components.
We provide details for the development of two distinct UAV versions based on the frame size: an F450 and a T650 UAV.
Moreover, we provide the details of additional hardware modules that extends the functionality of the UAVs.
To know which UAV and additional hardware can be used for which type of experiments, please read

.. admonition:: note

   The components listed above are all you need to build a UAV for manual flight. Optionally, if one wants to build a UAV for more advanced autonomous flight, one will need some of (your choice) the additional components listed below.

* **Companion computer**: the main computational unit on-board the UAV, used to compute most estimation, planning and control algorithms in real-time.

  *Choice*: the Intel NUC BXNUC10i7FNK2.

      :alt: alternate text
      :align: center

      Intel NUC BXNUC10i7FNK2

* **FTDI cable**: the FTDI cable is a USB to Serial (TTL level) converter which allows for a simple way to connect TTL interface devices to USB. The I/O pins of this FTDI cable are configured to operate at 5V. It basically enables the Pixhawk and the companion computer to communicate.

  *Choice*: To check correct name

     TODO ADD CORRECT NAME

* **DC-DC converter**: enables to provide the appropriate supply voltage to the companion computer which is typically in a different range of voltage/current/power as the battery.

  *Choice*: Wingoneer XL4016E1 (input: 4-40V, output: 1.25-36V at max 8A, max power: 200W). Since the 6S LiPo battery (i.e., a Turnigy Graphene Professional 12000mAh 6S15C LiPo Pack) provides at most 25.2V and at least 18.0V and the Intel NUC companion computer needs a supply voltage between 12V and 19V and has a rated power supply of 19V/6.33A, the converter must be able to take 18V-25.2V in and deliver 19V/6.33A (or 121W).
You can find `here https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/1134370/XLSEMI/XL4016E1.html>`__ the datasheet of the XL4016E1.

* **Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS**: RTK is a GPS-based positioning system that allows to get more precise (i.e., cm-precise) global (in XY and Z) position from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. It is used additionality to the standard GPS senor on-board the UAV which typically only obtain m-level precision. The RTK system typically consists of a stationary ground "base" station that sends corrections to an RTK module on-board the UAV which is called the "rover". Both devices individually can get GNSS measurements with usual GPS precision. The RTK system computes the baseline, the difference between both measurements then gives the roverâ€™s position relative to the base.

  *Choice*: the Emlid Reach M2 UAV Mapping Kit. It is composed of the Emlid Reach RS2 as the base and the Emlid Reach M2 attached to the UAV as the rover. To the latter is connected via a cable the Multi-band GNSS antenna.

   Once the final designs are finished of both your thesis, I will need the inventor files and all stl files of the UAV (also for the F450 from which you started). I will put them on a drive that people can download it. We cannot put it on github since too large files. 
   They are accessible here (TO DO).

We 3D print all these pieces with 20% infill:

* **Main piece (x 1)**: used to provide enough space for all the components. The PDB is fixed on its lower stage, the Pixhawk and its middle stage and the Intel NUC on its top stage.

Step-by-step assembly instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section you will learn how to fix all the components on their (custom-made) piece, assemble everything, and solder/connect every cable/connector to electronic components.

**Goal**: assemble the UAV that looks like in this CAD:

   in the picture above are missing several components. There is no NUC, battery, Reach M2, Antenna, GPS, ... A final assembly has ALL componenents (even screw). The only thing you cannot draw in CAD are the cables and connectors. If a user want to build it, it helps to see how all componenets fit in the custom-made parts.

**Required tools**:

.. admonition:: todo

   list the tools needed during the assembly: e.g. soldering iron, screwdriver numbers...

**Tips**:

.. admonition:: note

   Every time you solder cables, put a piece of shrink tube beforehand on the cables and heat them on the soldering once it is done.

**Steps**

.. admonition:: todo

   When building the second drone you need to add the steps of "Connecting the NUC on the drone" in this section in a logical order. 
   This should not be a seperate section as you need to explain the build procedure of how to build the autonomous drone (as you design is made for that one).

1. Mount the frame as explained `in this tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddvgs200OaY&ab_channel=MultiCopterBuild>`__. You only need to attach the arms to the body and you can skip the assembly of the legs and the top part.

2. Drill the holes of all the 3D printed pieces to deal with imperfections due to shrinkage. Use a drill bit of size 2.5mm for every hole **NOT** directly touching the frame. For the holes used to fix the parts on the frame itself, use a 3mm drill bit.

.. admonition:: todo

   I have difficulties understandign what you mean with these 2 categories of parts. Can you give a list of parts (see names above) that need which drill size?

   Take picture on white background (use a clean white sheet of paper, you can find those at the printer up the stairs in front of you). Make sure there are no unnecessary things (noise) in the picture. In this case we do not need to see the soldering yet. Crop the image to what is actually useful. **these comments applies to all pictures below you take of the prototype**


4. Take 3 jumper wires (more or less 30cm) with at least one female connector, remove the other connector and solder them to the three signal cables from the ESC (blue, brown and orange). Try to keep the same colors for all the ESCs. Repeat for all ESCs.

11. Take four pairs of power supply cables (more or less 18cm long, thick red and black cables, a single pair per motor). Make sure that the four pairs can reach the ESCs starting from the middle of the frame. Solder all the pairs on the power distribution board (PDB). The position of each pair is shown in the picture below. As the UAV requires four motors but the PDB can supply up to eight motors, you can solder each red cable to both B+ connections available on each corner of the PDB. In each corner, where the red cables are, choose one of the two GND connection to solder the black cables.

     Take new picture(s) with the following corrections:
     i) less noise, so do not show jumber cables going to the PDB as you did not tell this before in the instructions. If you forgot this, then add it in a step before. 
     ii) The lengths of the cables: say how long you cut the cables in the text above (e.g. XX cm), 
     iii) a pair with an XT60 connector on them (provided with the PDB) is not visible on the picture what you do with it. So maybe not important here, but say the elngth of the cable so if we don't see the cable we know at elast how long it should be.

12. Fix the PDB to the "Main piece" by help of 4x M3 bolts (head on bottom), use the 4 holes in the middle of the "Main piece". As you can see in the picture below the holes are off-centered. Put the cables with the XTC connector on the side with the biggest space (on the right in the picture below) and put them out of the piece thanks to the hole on that side (see second picture). In between the main piece and the PDB, put a nut on each bolt that serve as spacers.

Cable-Suspended Payload Module
-------------------------------

.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael: write this section on the the hardware design and construction of the module similar as we explained it for the UAV above. Make sure to take clean pictures on a white background without noise and that they are cropped. (see my comments before for UAV)

This module is installed at the bottom of the UAV and allows to measure the state (position and velocity) of a cable-suspended load hanging below the UAV. 

.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael todo: integrate the next section better in the hardware building chapter using a similar structure as for UAV (see example given below). Give more pictures and explain better each step of the setup.

Components
^^^^^^^^^^
This section lists all the components required to build the Suspended Payload Module for a UAV.
This is currently only compatible with the 650 UAV.

Off-the-shelf
*************

* **Encoders x2** : Sensor used to measure the actual orientation of the cable, fit inside the universal joint.

  *Choice*: `EMS22A <https://www.bourns.com/docs/product-datasheets/EMS22A.pdf>`__ because of its absolute nature, making it suitable to measure an absolute angle. It has a good resolution and its plain shaft makes it lightweight and compact, which is perfect to fit in the joint.

* **Arduino** : To process the data coming from the sensors and communicate with the controller.

   *Choice*: `Arduino Uno rev3 <https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3>`__

* **Stripboard** : to solder the electronic circuit between each components. I don't have the exact reference (no indication in thesis or old tutorial, no brand on the stripboard itself)

   *Suggested choice*: `Single-Sided Stripboard 50x100mm <https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/stripboards/2189160>`__ 
    Very small area reaquired, might take any other stribord even a smaller one.

* **Hex socket cap screw**

   *Choice*: `M2.5 x 12 mm <https://benl.rs-online.com/web/p/socket-screws/4838130>`__

Optionnal: 

* **Force sensor** : To deduce if the cable is well taut.

   *Choice*: `FSR04CE <https://www.mouser.be/datasheet/2/303/res_fsr-1590094.pdf>`__

* **Resistor** : To do a pull down circuit for measuring the output of the force sensor.

   Need to be 10k Ohms.
   

Custom-made
************
All the following parts need to be 3D printed with PLA and infill of 10 to 15%. LINK TO CAD FILES (not uploaded yet)

* **Center piece** : on which every other parts will be attached to. Must fit the colar clamps and the bearings. Separated in two parts to make assembly and printing possible.

Step-by-step assembly instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once everypart is ready, one can proceed with the assembly of the encoder system (mechanical and electronic).

Electronic circuit
******************
First, the electronic components can be assembled. This will require a soldring station as everything will be connected via the stripboard.
On the following figure, one can see the correct circuit to reproduce. 

.. figure:: _static/ElectronicCircuit.png
   :width: 800
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center

.. note::
  It is better to use flexible cables (REF ??? I used the one that are at the lab on big rolls) to do the circuit as rigid ones might disconnect more easily in case they are pulled a bit.

5 cables are needed per encoders. 2 are for the power (V+ and ground) and 3 are for the signal. To solder these correctly, put a small amount of tin on both the pin of the encoder and the cable. Then put the cable on the pin and heat up the two with the soldering iron. Both preapplied tin layers should melt easilly and fuse togheter on the pin. Once the shape of the weld is looking regular and well spreaded over the pin, just take out the iron and wait.
Don't hesitate to redo some of the weldings if they don't look strong enough, as it is very important that the cables stay in place. Also, the welds must not touch each other of course.
Once all the cables are welded to the encoder, cables from the same encoder can be attached togheter with tape to keep a readable circuit and avoid mistakes. 

Mechanical assembly 
*******************

.. admonition:: todo

   Raphael : When building the 2nd encoder, will do pictures of intermediate steps. 

* **Center piece**  Press fit the collard inside the hollow part of the center piece. When those are in place, connect the two part of the central piece and secure it using two bolts.

.. figure:: _static/PressFit.png

* **Add the bearings** also by doing press fit. Less tension needed as the arm will naturally keep them in place.

.. figure:: _static/BallBearing.png
   :width: 400

* **Assemble the lower arms** using bolt and adding already the attachment piece for the cable. 

* **Connect the support to the battery** 

* **Attach the upper arm to the center piece of the jont and to the support of the battery**.

* **Add the encoders** at the correct location on each arms

* **Screw the arduino on its support plate and screw the plate on the battery case**
