Manual Flight Procedures
=============================

.. admonition:: todo

   show (via text and pictures) that you are able to do a manual flight (on the field between vub and ulb) and discuss here all chronological procedures step by step. 
   make sure the user is taught to test the functionality of all bottons and switches on the RCT.


Make sure all parts (e.g., cables) on the UAV are well secured and cannot loosen during flight. Use zip ties and scratch tape. 


Follow these steps:

   add somewhere to measure the battery voltage before flight with the small device. Explain where to plug it and how to set the beep if you use it.

.. admonition:: note

   For beginners it is advised to leach the UAV before taking off as to physically restrict its available fight space. 
   * Attach the leash under the UAV such that it hangs below the propellors;
   * Unroll enough rope such that you are not too close to the UAV. The longer the rope, the further the UAV is allowed to fly;
   * Attach the leash to a weight or hold it firmly.

* Go to an open space under normal weather conditions. Never fly under too windy conditions. An ideal location is far away from people (bystanders are disturbers which is a safety risk for everyone nearby) or public spaces (roads, rails, ...), has a clear sky visibility for the GPS (don't go under trees).
* Make sure the battery of the UAV is unplugged. Put the UAV at a stable flat leveled surface. Watch out for tiles or high grass since uneven surfaces can cause the UAV feet to get stuck during takeoff and tilt the UAV on the ground. If this would happen directly toggle the emergency switch F down (towards the operator).
* Take the transmitter. Make sure the thrust control is fully down, all switches are toggles up, and all the trims are zeroed.
* Power the transmitter on and click yes when asked "ready to transmit?". Under MDL SEL select the correct UAV. Check that the battery of the transmitter is charged enough.
* Set switch A on attitude hold (middle) or down (position hold). Controlling the UAV in \bc{mode name?} (up) is a lot harder. Position hold is the easiest mode.
* Wait for the GPS to become "fixed". Depending on the outdoor conditions this can take some minutes. This is indicated by a high toned sound and the GPS LED will blink green slowly. Now press the safety switch on the GPS. You will hear a small beep.
* Put yourself in a position a few meters away from the UAV. Best to place yourself behind the UAV so that you can easily see which motion roll and pitch would produce. 
* If you use a safety rope, make sure someone is holding it (not tight, but loose) and that the rope does not get entangled with any part of the UAV (e.g. the UAV feet).
* When ready for takeoff you can toggle the switch C fully down. The props will start spinning at a low speed. The thrust is not enough for the UAV to takeoff. If you now don't do anything for a few seconds, the props will stop spinning. If this happens toggle switch C up again. Now don't wait and raise the thrust well over 50\%. Now the UAV should takeoff. 
* You can play around with the UAV via the joysticks. Make sure you learn to master the UAV safely. Remember that the emergency switch F will disable the motors of the UAV and the UAV will fall down. Only use it at very low altitudes or in very dangerous situations.
* To land the UAV in a normal situation, lower the throttle stick and just before the feet hit the ground (5cm) toggle switch C up. This should stop the motors from spinning.


.. admonition:: note

   In the case the UAV always tilts during takeoff try the following things subsequently if it remains unsolved.

   * Takeoff on a surface which is very flat.
   * Delete the firmware from the pixhawk SD card, reinstall the firmware and re-calibrate everything. 
   * If the UAV always flips in the same direction try replacing the motors and or ESCs at the direction to which the UAV flips.
